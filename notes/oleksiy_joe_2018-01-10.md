## Question 1: Which fields?

The `as_portfolio` table has 141 columns. Which of them do we want to allow the user to filter by?

## Question 2: Where should portfolio manipulation occur?

Should portfolio manipulation (adding/removing projects to a portfoio) have its own dedicated page, or should those controls be visible throughout the entire app?

## Question 3: What is getting downloaded?

I understand that part of specs is to generate an html / pdf for download. What should the contents of that download be?
